# Description

The smart contract is named Tokening and is written in Solidity version ^0.8.18. It is designed to represent a simple token with functionalities for minting (creating new tokens) and burning (destroying tokens). The contract also stores information about the token, such as its name, symbol, and the total supply of tokens. The contract utilizes a mapping named balances to keep track of the token balances associated with different addresses. The contract includes three public variables. The tokenName variable is of type string and is initialized with the value "Shiva". The tokenSymbol variable is also a string type and initialized with the value "Hi". The totalSupply variable is of type uint256 and is initialized with a value of 0. Being public variables, their values can be accessed from outside the contract using corresponding getter functions.
To manage token balances, the contract utilizes a mapping called balances. This mapping maps Ethereum addresses to their corresponding token balances. The type of the mapping is mapping(address => uint256), meaning it associates addresses with unsigned integer values representing token balances. The balances in this mapping are updated whenever tokens are minted or burned. The mint function is also an external function, and it takes two parameters: _to (address) and _value (uint256). This function is used to create new tokens and assign them to a specific address (_to). However, to prevent tokens from being created with an invalid or zero address, the function includes a require statement to check that _to is not equal to the zero address. When tokens are minted, both the totalSupply and the balance of the recipient in the balances mapping are increased accordingly. Finally, the contract includes the burn function, which is an external function that allows users to burn (destroy) their own tokens. The function takes one parameter, _value, representing the number of tokens to be burned. Before burning, the function checks that the user has enough tokens to perform the operation (i.e., their balance is greater than or equal to the _value). If the condition is met, the function reduces the totalSupply and updates the user's balance in the balances mapping accordingly. This ensures that tokens are securely removed from circulation when burned by users.
